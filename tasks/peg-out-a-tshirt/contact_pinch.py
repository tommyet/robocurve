"""Unvalidated contact-guided ordinary jaw controller for a scripted demo.

Native cloth positions choose finger targets only. No simulator mutator,
attachment, material edit or success signal is available. The fixed target
remains the lower aperture bound; feedback can relieve compression by opening.
This is not a Dream observation or a claim of force-sensor fidelity.
